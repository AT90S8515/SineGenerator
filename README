  Description: Sine tone generator with adjustable frequency
        Notes:

This is a simple quad sine tone generator I needed for an experiment.
The output frequencies (0..11.5kHz) and amplitudes are set with the
sliders. The "/10" checkbox gives you better control over lower
frequencies. Press the "Reset Phase" button if you want to realign
oscillators whose frequencies are multiples of each other.
